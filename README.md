## 🧠 Code Quality and Learning Context

While some projects may not fully reflect best practices in maintainability or performance optimization, this is due to the **original scope and constraints** of the coursework.

Through courses such as:

🧩 Software Design Analysis 🧩  
🧪 Software Quality and Testing 🧪  
🧼 Software Specification and RE 🧼

—I’ve developed the ability to **critically assess, improve, and justify architectural and design choices** when needed.
